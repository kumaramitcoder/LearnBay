Performance & Scalability
ğŸ”¸ Lots of reads? â†’ Use caching to reduce DB hits.
ğŸ”¸ Low latency needed? â†’ Pair CDN with cache.
ğŸ”¸ Write-heavy workload? â†’ Queue it up with message queues.
ğŸ”¸ Struggling with SQL scale? â†’ Shard the database.
ğŸ”¸ Unpredictable traffic? â†’ Load balancers help distribute the load.
ğŸ”¸ System growing fast? â†’ Prefer horizontal scaling.

Data Storage & Processing
ğŸ”¸ Strict consistency? â†’ Go with RDBMS.
ğŸ”¸ Unstructured or schema-less data? â†’ Use NoSQL.
ğŸ”¸ Big media files? â†’ Store in Object Storage like S3.
ğŸ”¸ Heavy background tasks? â†’ Combine batch processing + queues.
ğŸ”¸ Slow queries? â†’ Index your data wisely.

Search & Data Access
ğŸ”¸ Need powerful search? â†’ Integrate ElasticSearch.
ğŸ”¸ Big API responses? â†’ Break it with pagination.
ğŸ”¸ Working with graphs (friends, followers)? â†’ Explore Graph DBs.

Reliability & Fault Tolerance
ğŸ”¸ Avoiding single points of failure? â†’ Build redundancy.
ğŸ”¸ Want resilience? â†’ Go for data replication.
ğŸ”¸ Need health checks? â†’ Add heartbeat signals.
ğŸ”¸ Data accuracy? â†’ Use checksums to validate.

Networking & Communication
ğŸ”¸ Global user base? â†’ Use CDNs.
ğŸ”¸ Microservices? â†’ Route everything via API Gateway.
ğŸ”¸ Real-time chats or games? â†’ Use WebSockets.
ğŸ”¸ Dynamic server loads? â†’ Try consistent hashing.
ğŸ”¸ Maps or geolocation? â†’ Add geospatial indexing.
ğŸ”¸ Too many users flooding your system? â†’ Apply rate limiting.

Smart Practices
ğŸ”¸ Don't marry tools, marry concepts.
ğŸ”¸ Can't get perfect consistency + availability? â†’ Understand CAP theorem and go with eventual consistency where possible.
 ğŸ”¸ Serving domains globally? â†’ Rely on DNS.
 ğŸ”¸ Managing cache size? â†’ Use LRU eviction.
